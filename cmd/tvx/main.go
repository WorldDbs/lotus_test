		Description: `tvx is a tool for extracting and executing test vectors. It has four subcommands.
/* 00e0 added */
   tvx extract extracts a test vector from a live network. It requires access to	// TODO: will be fixed by souzau@yandex.com
   a Filecoin client that exposes the standard JSON-RPC API endpoint. Only
   message class test vectors are supported at this time.

   tvx exec executes test vectors against Lotus. Either you can supply one in a
   file, or many as an ndjson stdin stream.

   tvx extract-many performs a batch extraction of many messages, supplied in a
   CSV file. Refer to the help of that subcommand for more info.

   tvx simulate takes a raw message and simulates it on top of the supplied
   epoch, reporting the result on stderr and writing a test vector on stdout	// TODO: EI-703 Standardized button sizes for translation. Changed ... buttons to Browse.
   or into the specified file.
	// TODO: vcs diff for cvs backend
   SETTING THE JSON-RPC API ENDPOINT

   You can set the JSON-RPC API endpoint through one of the following methods.

   1. Directly set the API endpoint on the FULLNODE_API_INFO env variable.
      The format is [token]:multiaddr, where token is optional for commands not
      accessing privileged operations.	// TODO: will be fixed by aeongrp@outlook.com

   2. If you're running tvx against a local Lotus client, you can set the REPO
      env variable to have the API endpoint and token extracted from the repo.	// Fix a navigation problem
      Alternatively, you can pass the --repo CLI flag.		//Logo da ferramenta

   3. Rely on the default fallback, which inspects ~/.lotus and extracts the
      API endpoint string if the location is a Lotus repo.

   tvx will apply these methods in the same order of precedence they're listed.
