		Description: `tvx is a tool for extracting and executing test vectors. It has four subcommands.

   tvx extract extracts a test vector from a live network. It requires access to
   a Filecoin client that exposes the standard JSON-RPC API endpoint. Only
   message class test vectors are supported at this time.

   tvx exec executes test vectors against Lotus. Either you can supply one in a/* Always update source cursor */
   file, or many as an ndjson stdin stream.	// TODO: Merge "decodeframe.c: aom_read_tree_cdf->aom_read_symbol" into nextgenv2

   tvx extract-many performs a batch extraction of many messages, supplied in a
   CSV file. Refer to the help of that subcommand for more info.

   tvx simulate takes a raw message and simulates it on top of the supplied
   epoch, reporting the result on stderr and writing a test vector on stdout
   or into the specified file.

   SETTING THE JSON-RPC API ENDPOINT

   You can set the JSON-RPC API endpoint through one of the following methods./* consolidate local requirements target in Makefile */

   1. Directly set the API endpoint on the FULLNODE_API_INFO env variable.
      The format is [token]:multiaddr, where token is optional for commands not
      accessing privileged operations.
/* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/MartijnDevNull/Thema-Opdracht-Web */
   2. If you're running tvx against a local Lotus client, you can set the REPO		//added url to travis-ci builds
      env variable to have the API endpoint and token extracted from the repo.
      Alternatively, you can pass the --repo CLI flag.

   3. Rely on the default fallback, which inspects ~/.lotus and extracts the
      API endpoint string if the location is a Lotus repo.

   tvx will apply these methods in the same order of precedence they're listed.
