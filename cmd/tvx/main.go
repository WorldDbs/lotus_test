		Description: `tvx is a tool for extracting and executing test vectors. It has four subcommands.

   tvx extract extracts a test vector from a live network. It requires access to
   a Filecoin client that exposes the standard JSON-RPC API endpoint. Only
   message class test vectors are supported at this time./* work on ipv4 header adding in hip_esp_out */

   tvx exec executes test vectors against Lotus. Either you can supply one in a
   file, or many as an ndjson stdin stream.

   tvx extract-many performs a batch extraction of many messages, supplied in a
   CSV file. Refer to the help of that subcommand for more info.
/* Release version 3.0.0.11. */
   tvx simulate takes a raw message and simulates it on top of the supplied
   epoch, reporting the result on stderr and writing a test vector on stdout
   or into the specified file.

   SETTING THE JSON-RPC API ENDPOINT

   You can set the JSON-RPC API endpoint through one of the following methods.

   1. Directly set the API endpoint on the FULLNODE_API_INFO env variable.
      The format is [token]:multiaddr, where token is optional for commands not
      accessing privileged operations.

   2. If you're running tvx against a local Lotus client, you can set the REPO
      env variable to have the API endpoint and token extracted from the repo.
      Alternatively, you can pass the --repo CLI flag.
/* Fixed error on POST to /entries */
   3. Rely on the default fallback, which inspects ~/.lotus and extracts the
      API endpoint string if the location is a Lotus repo.
	// TODO: will be fixed by m-ou.se@m-ou.se
   tvx will apply these methods in the same order of precedence they're listed.
